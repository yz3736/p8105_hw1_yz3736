This is my solution to Homework 1.

I create a r markdown file.

Note:
Problem 1 is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

Problem 2 focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.
